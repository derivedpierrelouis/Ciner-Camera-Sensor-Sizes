Ciner: Camera Sensor Sizes
Created by Derived Pierre-Louis

What is a "Sensor Size":

Sensor Size is the width and height of a camera's image sensor.
35mm or 36x24 is used as the base when comparing different sensor sizes.

What does this have to do with Unity:

In Unity, the camera component has an option to enable "Physical Camera", this allows the camera to act and function like a real-world camera. In virtual production, it is
important to use real-world measurements and configurations, it allows for a faster workflow, and no unnecessary conversions. I wanted to take this a step further and so I 
made a tool that provides most,if not all the sensor sizes you'll need from brands such as:

Arri
Blackmagic
Red Digital
Canon
Sony
Panasonic
Fujifilm
Nikon

How to USE the asset:

Inside the "Ciner" folder, you'll find a "Body" folder and inside that folder, you'll find all the cameras listed above, once you have selected the brand, drag and drop the script on your scene's camera, it will change the camera's sensor size to the camera type you selected, it will also
change the name of your scene's camera to the selected camera type.
